            <p>The Airbus A340 is a long-range, wide-body passenger airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus.
                In
                the mid-1970s, Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300, its first airliner, and developed the
                A340
                quadjet in parallel with the A330 twinjet. In June 1987, Airbus launched both designs with their first
                orders and the A340-300 took its maiden flight on 25 October 1991. It was certified along with the
                A340-200
                on 22 December 1992 and both versions entered service in March 1993 with launch customers Lufthansa and
                Air
                France. The larger A340-500/600 were launched on 8 December 1997; the A340-600 flew for the first time
                on 23
                April 2001 and entered service on 1 August 2002.</p>

            <p>
                The first variant of the A340 to be introduced, the A340-200, entered service with the launch customer,
                Lufthansa, in 1993. It was followed shortly thereafter by the A340-300 with its operator, Air France.
                Lufthansa's first A340, which had been dubbed Nürnberg (D-AIBA), began revenue service on 15 March
                1993. Air Lanka (later renamed Sri Lankan Airlines) became the Asian launch customer of the
                Airbus A340; the airline received its first A340-300, registered (4R-ADA), in September 1994. British
                airline Virgin Atlantic was an early adopter of the A340; in addition to operating several A340-300
                aircraft, Virgin Atlantic announced in August 1997 that it was to be the worldwide launch customer for
                the new A340-600. The first commercial flight of the A340-600 was performed by Virgin in July
                2002.
