                The Boeing 747 is a large, long-range wide-body airliner designed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial
                Airplanes in the United States between 1968 and 2023. After introducing the 707 in October 1958, Pan Am
                wanted a jet 2+1⁄2 times its size, to reduce its seat cost by 30%. In 1965, Joe Sutter left the 737
                development program to design the 747. In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 Boeing 747-100 aircraft, and in
                late 1966, Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop the JT9D engine, a high-bypass turbofan. On September 30,
                1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the custom-built Everett Plant, the world's largest building by
                volume. The 747's first flight took place on February 9, 1969, and the 747 was certified in December of
                that year. It entered service with Pan Am on January 22, 1970. The 747 was the first airplane called a
                "Jumbo Jet" as the first wide-body airliner.

                Developing the 747 had been a major challenge, and building its assembly plant was also a huge
                undertaking. Boeing president William M. Allen asked Malcolm T. Stamper, then head of the company's
                turbine division, to oversee construction of the Everett factory and to start production of the 747.
                To level the site, more than four million cubic yards (three million cubic meters) of earth had to be
                moved. Time was so short that the 747's full-scale mock-up was built before the factory roof above
                it was finished. The plant is the largest building by volume ever built, and has been substantially
                expanded several times to permit construction of other models of Boeing wide-body commercial jets.
